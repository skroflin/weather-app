# Weather App

Basic react frontend application which calls `https://www.weatherapi.com/docs/` to fetch weather data for some cities. Cities for which the API is called are contained in `src\Components\Cities.ts` as a list of cities.

## Build and run
To run the app you need to generate an API key and add it to your `.env` file under `REACT_APP_API_KEY`. Then just install and run it
```
npm install
npm start
```
